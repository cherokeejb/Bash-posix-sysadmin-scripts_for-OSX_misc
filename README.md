# bash-sysadmin-misc
Here are sanitized, fairly simple bash scripts I wrote and used in production at a former employer, on OSX.  This may include future, unrelated scripts as well of course.  They were usually hidden in the home directory of an admin account like /Users/[username]/.scriptname

In some cases this may save the need for expensive management software like Casper/Jamf and assist in keeping the network quickly secure and organized/inventoried.  Using the the bash script in Launch Agents was multiple times faster than apple script.
