# bash-sysadmin-misc
Here are sanitized, fairly simple bash scripts I wrote and used in production at a former employer, on OSX.  This may include future, unrelated scripts as well of course.  They were usually hidden in the home directory of an admin account like /Users/[username]/.scriptname

#CUT TO The CHASE::
These scripts along with other innovations saved my employer hundreds of thousands of Euros in costs which would have otherwise been needed by an expensive "easy management" software like Casper/Jamf, and helped keep the network quickly secure and organized/inventoried, with the naming script esepcially, to quickly add in new systems.

This also greatly sped up elements of the workflow for IT, Security, and other technicians.  Among other things we reduced the login time for a studio workstation down to an additional time of less than one second, from previously 15 seconds or more, and , and found simple ways for systems with hundreds of users to access the same, legal software licenses for core-value software applications.  Some of these were also automated further, using Apple Remote Desktop (ARD), Deploy Studio, and others.

These steps and others were part of a complete security policy, procedures, and IT policy which I created as the company grew from a start-up into a multi-million dollar organization, and a leader in their field.  The sum of this work, including some elemnts here; for example, increased the stabilitiy and security of the imaging process for IT, automated updates, and cut the time needed for rollouts of new softare, in half.

I also would like to add in other "more fun" project / elements from my Linux systems or Bash scripts here as well, as time allows.  One script I need to re-write was a CLI application for the website https://dict.leo.org (a widely used German-to-English dictionary and discussion forum).
