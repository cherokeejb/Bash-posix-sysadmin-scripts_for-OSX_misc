# This just needs to copy the master Ableton and Plugin Alliance authorizations, after authorization
#	into the library and system library for new users

# These programs use machine-based authorizations, sometimes PA works from simply copying the license in the local Library
# 	We do most else in the new User templates & device mdm, and a few things like Desktop images and mount points in user mdm profiles
#	# Templates include fixes like passing an Ableton preferences and database (with userlibrary removed), and Options.txt
#		#and preventing roam on the network for files in the User hierchy for Ableton (not currently needed)
